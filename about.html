            <h1>Life is too short to put things off</h1>
            <p class="teaser__subheading--smaller">Someone said to me the other day, "When I retire, I'm going to travel the world." A good joke. When you retire, you have diabetes, high blood pressure and take 5 different tablets every day. You have to carry the pills with you because otherwise you won't survive. Great prospects for a trip around the world. <br> 
                You have a great idea. Awesome. Then let's work together and get your idea out into the world.</p>
            <div class="teaser__cta">

        <div class="wrapper--blog">
            <section class="article">
            <h2>My story</h2>
            <p>I had this thing in my hand and thought it couldn't be.</p>
            <p>A world collapsed inside me, even though I had consciously decided to do it. But who would have thought it would happen so quickly.
            </p>
            <p>I was pregnant. Bloody hell. I had just graduated from university. And still no job in sight.</p>
            <p>Was I panicking?</p>
            <p>Yes.</p>
            <p>I would never find a job. And if I didn't work after graduation, no one would take me after parental leave.</p>
            <p>After panic comes escape. Which is more difficult with a baby.</p>
            <p>I didn't have to do much convincing. Philipp thought it was a great idea to travel with a child and take a year of parental leave.</p>
            <p>During this time, I cancelled my plan to write a doctoral thesis. Instead, I trained in graphic design, web design, SEO and copywriting. Meanwhile, I designed and coded a few websites. I have written articles that appear on the first page.</p>
            <p>I am ready to offer you my help. I can assist you in creating a professional website. I can show you how to create content that people want to read and that will rank on Google and other sites.
            </p>
            <p>You want to win the hearts of search engines and users with a presentable website and your content?</p>
            <p>Then let's talk.</p>
            <h2>What am I here for?</h2>
            <p>I'm here to help you become visible to the right people and make an impression. Without throwing money out the window.                 
            </p>
            <p>Yes, exactly!</p>
            <p>No money for Facebook and Google. And if so, then only as an extra, but not as a main strategy.</p>

            <h2>What is my mission?</h2>
            <p>I would like to help other self-employed people, small businesses and projects to improve their web presence in the online world. 
            </p>
            <p>How do I do it?</p>
            <p>With a professional and state-of-the-art website that ranks on page 1 with quality content and captivates its readers.</p>
                <p>Too difficult?</p>
                <p>No.</p>
                <p>But you need brainpower, patience and high standards.</p>
            <p>I want to help those who cannot afford an expensive web design and SEO agency, to be seen and found alongside the big companies.</p>

            <h2>What is important to me?</h2>
            <p>I have a <strong>positive attitude</strong>. I want to achieve my goals. That also includes falling. I see criticism and falls as positive. But only when I am criticised I can improve something. I grow from it and become better.</p>
            <p>I <strong>believe in myself</strong> (not always easy for me). I know that it takes time and commitment, to achieve something. I work on myself and my goals.</p>
            <p>I prefer to work <strong>together</strong> on projects. I value the mutual feedback and the competences of the individual.</p>
            <p>I want to remain <strong>open</strong> and flexible - even when I am an old granny. I believe that the world is more human through tolerance, acceptance and respect.</p>
            <p>I want to stay <strong>modest</strong> my whole life. I appreciate the little things in life. I want to live consciously and mindfully.</p>
            <p><strong>Quality</strong> takes time. But perfection takes much longer. I deliver quality. My standards are high: I want to write the best article and design the best website. But I'm not a perfectionist. I want you to get ahead. I'd rather tackle imperfectly than procrastinate because I want it to be perfect. I accept mistakes and correct them. 
            </p>
            <p><strong>Thinking out of the box</strong>, is one of my ways of finding other solutions and taking other paths. I question a lot. I combine and think differently: we don't all have to follow the same well-trodden path. There is no such thing as the one right way. These qualities help me to overcome boundaries and boxes.</p>
